# Simple exchange rate app in TypeScript

This is a simple web application that allows users to convert currency based on the latest exchange rates. It utilizes the ExchangeRate-API to fetch conversion rates for a selected base currency and then updates the UI to display the conversion rate when the user selects a target currency. The app consists of HTML elements for selecting base and target currencies, and a paragraph element to display the conversion result. The JavaScript code handles API requests, updates the conversion rates array, and performs the currency conversion when the user makes a selection.
